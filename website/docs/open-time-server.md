# General

[OCP TAP](https://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Time_Appliances_Project) is targeting to ease the addition of Time-sync as a service to the datacenter. The Project targets are to define the service requirements, deployment, and design of an open reference design.

The time-sync service is relying on a synchronization technology, for now, we are adopting PTP (IEEE 1588) with some addition to that and NTP.

PTP architecture is scalable and defines the time source from an entity called the **Time Server clock** (or stratum 1 in NTP terms). The Open Time Server is distributing time to the entire network and usually gets its timing from an external source, (GNSS signal).

The current state-of-the-art Open Time Server implementations suffer from a few drawbacks that we wish to accommodate:

- They are HW appliances that usually target different GTM than a DC
- They expose none standard and inconsistent Interfaces and SW feature-sets
- Development cycles and the effort needed to add new features are long and expensive
- It doesn’t rely on open-source software
- The accuracy/stability grades aren’t in line with DC requirements

# High-Level Architecture

In general, the OTS is divided into 3 HW components:

1. COTS server
2. Commodity NIC
3. Time Card

![Open Time Server System Diagram](/img/open-time-server/overall.png)

<p align="center">Figure 1. Open Time Server System Diagram</p>
The philosophy behind this fragmentation is very clear, and each decision, modification that will be made, must look-out to this philosophy:

- COTS servers keep their “value for money” due to huge market requirements. They are usually updated with the latest OS version, security patches, and newer technology, faster than HW appliances.
- Modern Commodity NICs already support HW timestamp, lead the market with Ethernet and PCIe latest Speeds and Feeds. Modern NIC also supports a wide range of OS versions and comes with a great software ecosystem. NIC + COTS server will allow the OTS to run a full software (and even open source one) PTP and NTP stack.
- Timecard will be the smallest (conceptually) possible HW board, which will provide the GNSS signal input and stable frequency input. Isolating these functions in a timecard will allow OTS to choose the proper timecard for their needs (accuracy, stability, cost, etc) and remain with the same SW, interface, and architecture.

![Open Time Server Concept](/img/open-time-server/OTS_concept.png)

<p align="center">Figure 2. Open Time Server Concept</p>

General Idea is the Time Card is connected via PCIe to the server and provides Time Of Day (TOD) via `/dev/ptpX` interface.  
Using this interface `phc2sys` continuously synchronizes PHC on the network card from the atomic clock on the Time Card. This provides precision < 1us.  
For the extremely high precision 1PPS output of the Time Card will be connected to the 1PPS input of the NIC, providing <100ns precision.

## COTS Server

### Hardware

Most of the general purpose hardware can be used.  
vt-d CPU support is required.  
If multi-CPU system is chosen - we recommend connecting the Time Card and the Network Card to the same PCIe lane.  
Synchronization between multiple CPUs will add an extra offset.

We've tested and proved setup is working with the following platform spec:

- HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10
- OCP Tioga Pass
- SuperMicro 6019U-TRT - single or dual CPU
- SuperMicro 5019GP-TT - single socket with maximum throughput
- Intel NUC 9 Pro

### Software

Please detailed [software description](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/Time-Appliance-Project/tree/master/Software) document

- Linux operating system with the [ocp_ptp driver](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/Time-Appliance-Project/tree/master/Time-Card/DRV) (included in Linux kernel 5.12 and newer). Driver may require vt-d CPU flag enabled in BIOS
- NTP server - [Chrony](https://github.com/mlichvar/chrony)/NTPd reading `/dev/ptpX` of the Time Card
- PTP server - [ptp4u](https://github.com/facebook/time/tree/main/ptp/ptp4u) or [ptp4l](https://github.com/richardcochran/linuxptp) reading `/dev/ptpX` of the NIC
  - [phc2sys](https://github.com/richardcochran/linuxptp)/[ts2phc](https://github.com/richardcochran/linuxptp) to copy clock values from the Time Card to the NIC

## NIC

Most of the general purpose hardware can be used.  
For the improved precision of NTP or PTP there can be extra requirements below.

### Form-Factor

- Standard PCIe Stand-up HHHL Half-Height, Half-Length -or- [OCP NIC 3.0](https://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Server/Mezz)
- Single Slot - Passive Cooling Solution
- Support for Standard PCIe Tall and Short brackets -or- OCP NIC 3.0 ejector types

### PCIe Interface

- PCIe Gen3.0/Gen4.0 X n lanes on Gold-fingers, where n = at least 8

### Network Ports

- Single or Dual-port Ethernet

### Hardware timestamps

NIC should timestamp all ingress packets.  
Non PTP packets can be batch and have a common TS in the SW descriptor, as long as they are not distant more than TBD nanosecond.  
NIC should timestamp all PPP egress packets.

- PHC
- PTM
- 1PPS input
- [optional] 10MHz input which can be used as frequency input to the TSU unit
- [optional] Multi-host support

### PPS out

- PPS Out Rise/Fall Time < 5 nano Sec
- PPS Out Delay < 400 pico Sec
- PPS Out Jitter < 250 femto Sec
- PPS Out Impedance = 50 Ohm
- PPS Out frequency 1Hz - 10MHz

### PPS In

- PPS In Delay < 400 pico Sec
- PPS In Jitter < 250 femto Sec
- PPS In Impedance = 50 Ohm
- PPS In frequency 1Hz - 10MHz

## Time Card

Please see [Time Card details architecture](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/Time-Appliance-Project/tree/master/Time-Card) document or simply visit www.timingcard.com.

General Idea is this card will be connected via PCIe to the server and provide Time Of Day (TOD) via `/dev/ptpX` interface. Using this interface `phc2sys` will continuously synchronize PHC on the network card from the atomic clock on the Time Card. This provides precision < 1us.

For the extremely high precision 1PPS output of the Time Card should be connected to the 1PPS input of the NIC. In this setup `ts2phc` can provide < 100ns precision.
